# 🧠 JS Piscine Contributions

Hi! I’m **Software Sappho**  
Welcome to my corner of code — this repository contains my contributions during the **JavaScript Piscine** at **Zone01**.

The Piscine ("swimming pool") is an intense, fast-paced immersion into programming. Over several days, we dove deep into JavaScript fundamentals, tackling real challenges with little hand-holding. It was tough, rewarding, and full of "aha!" moments. This repo documents my growth — with all the wins, bugs, and lessons along the way.

## 📁 Project Structure

You'll find my work organized by quests — each folder represents a core concept or challenge area:

```

.
├── async/           # Promises, async/await, callbacks
├── call-me-maybe/   # Function and context handling
├── data/            # Data structures and manipulation
├── dom/             # DOM interaction and manipulation
├── find/            # Search, filtering, logic challenges
├── loop/            # Iteration patterns and loops
├── node/            # Node.js-based scripting
├── object/          # Object-oriented JS and manipulation
└── time/            # Time-based functions and scheduling

````

Each folder typically contains one or more `.js` files representing individual exercises or mini-projects.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/software-sappho/Piscine-JS.git
   cd Piscine-JS
    ```

2. **Run JavaScript files**
   Many of the exercises can be run directly in your terminal using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):

   ```bash
   node loop/chunky.js
   ```

3. **Check for requirements**
   Some exercises expect input files, command-line arguments, or are designed to be part of a broader script. Read any comments inside the files for clues.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run most scripts here, you'll need:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18+ recommended)
* A terminal or shell (e.g. Bash, Zsh, Git Bash, etc.)
* A curious mind and willingness to debug 🙂

## 💡 Notes
This repo is more than just code — it’s a snapshot of learning in motion.

I struggled. A lot. Some days, nothing made sense. I spent hours researching, digging through documentation, reading others' code, and piecing together scattered hints. And that’s okay — it’s part of the journey.

If you’re looking through this repo, you might be on your own Piscine path or trying to learn JavaScript. I hope these files help you, whether it’s for inspiration, debugging, or just knowing someone else fought through the same confusion.

Feel free to run it, break it, fix it — that’s how we learn.

And if you're currently in the thick of a bootcamp or Piscine: **keep going**. It’s not meant to be easy, but it is absolutely worth it. Trust the process, be curious, and don’t be afraid to ask questions — or to Google the same thing five times in one day.

You’re not alone. 🌱
